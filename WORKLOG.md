# Social Studies Quiz — Work & Decision Log

## Project Overview
A mobile-friendly study quiz for 5th grade social studies (Chapters 5 & 6 — Colonial America). Built as a standalone HTML file deployed to Azure Static Web Apps.

## Key Decisions

### Architecture
- **Single HTML file** — no server, no build step, no dependencies. All HTML/CSS/JS inline in `index.html`.
- **localStorage** for persistence — saves quiz progress and any parent edits across browser sessions (per device).
- **Standalone deployment** — Azure Static Web App (free tier), auto-deploys on push to `main`.

### Content Source
- Study material from `socialtest.pdf` (scanned, 2 pages).
- PDF was OCR'd using Docker + Tesseract → converted to `socialtest.docx` for review.
- User reviewed and edited the Word doc before content was used.

### Quiz Design
- **Section 1 — Vocabulary (20 terms):** Fill-in-the-blank with clickable word bank. Definitions written at 5th grade reading level based on colonial America curriculum.
- **Section 2 — Multiple Choice (17 questions):** 4 choices each — 1 correct, 2 plausible, 1 obviously wrong (kid-friendly humor).
- **Scoring:** Shows results with encouragement messages. Retry mode shows only missed questions.
- **Parent Mode:** Password-protected (`dad`). Two tabs: Answer Key and Edit Questions (edit any term, definition, question, or answer choice — saved to localStorage).

### Terms Included
Charter, Indentured Servant, Roanoke Island, Almanac, Pilgrim, Persecution, Debtor, Apprentice, Artisan, Squanto, Cash Crop, John Smith, Mayflower Compact, William Penn, Puritans, Francis Drake, Proprietor, Town Common, James Oglethorpe, Elizabeth Lucas Pinckney

### Deployment
- **GitHub repo:** `jrbanach/socialtest`
- **Azure Static Web App:** Free tier, linked to GitHub repo, auto-deploys on push to `main`
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions workflow generated by Azure SWA

### Tools Used
- Docker (python:3.12-slim) for PDF OCR (Tesseract + pdfplumber)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) for repo creation
- Azure CLI (`az`) for Static Web App creation
- Copilot CLI for code generation

## How to Update
1. Edit `index.html` locally or via Parent Mode in the browser
2. If editing the file directly: push to `main` and Azure auto-deploys
3. If editing via Parent Mode: changes are saved in localStorage (browser-only, won't affect the deployed default)
4. To change default questions permanently: edit the `DEFAULT_VOCAB` and `DEFAULT_MC` arrays in `index.html`

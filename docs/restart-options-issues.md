## Issues
1. **State Persistence**: Ensuring that the game's state is appropriately reset when restarting.
2. **User Experience**: Determining how the restart option is presented to users and if it interrupts ongoing gameplay.
3. **Data Loss**: Addressing potential data loss for players who may want to save their progress before a restart.
4. **Testing Requirements**: Identifying testing scenarios needed to validate the new feature adequately.

## Conclusion
Further discussion is needed to resolve these issues effectively before implementation can commence.
